<p>This is Mezuro! A <strong>free</strong> (with the same meaning as freedom) web platform for <strong>collaborative</strong> source code <strong>evalution</strong>.</p>

<p>Here you can evaluate your source code with most of the SCM, just by giving it's URL. For now you can evaluate <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C/C++</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> source-code, but soon we hope to support more languages!</p>
